## A few words about me

I am originally from Belarus, came to Poland in 2021, and now I continue to study cybersecurity at the Wrocław university of science and technology. My work experience began at the age of 16 when I took on my first freelance orders. After a certain break, I started an internship at Dolby. In the future, I plan to more actively study technologies related to backend development. My goal is to combine all my skills and knowledge into one in order to be a truly sought-after specialist. I can characterize myself as a sociable, responsible, purposeful team member. I’m looking for a team to grow faster, improve my skills and gain new ones.
